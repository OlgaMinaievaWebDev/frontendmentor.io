# Frontend Mentor - Product list with cart solution

This is a solution to the [Product list with cart challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d).

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click **Confirm Order**
- Reset their selections when they click **Start New Order**
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- React (via Vite) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- Flexbox & CSS Grid - For layout and responsive design
- React Context API - For global state management of cart data
- React Portals - To render modal confirmation outside the main DOM tree

### What I learned

- How to manage state globally using React Context for cart items and quantities
- How to implement modals with React portals for better UI layering
- Handling complex UI interactions such as incrementing/decrementing item counts in a cart
- Using Tailwind CSS to quickly build responsive and accessible UI components
- Best practices for structuring React apps with reusable components and context providers

### Continued development

- Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for modals and buttons
- Add animation to modal appearance and cart updates for enhanced UX
- Connect with a backend API to persist cart data and support user authentication
- Add unit and integration testing for components and context logic using Jest and React Testing Library
